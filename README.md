# AI_MarksEntrySystem
A smart system that automates the transcription of handwritten marks into structured Excel sheets using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This project enhances accuracy, reduces manual errors, and simplifies academic evaluations.

# Features:

* Automated Handwritten Mark Recognition: Converts handwritten digits into digital format.
* Excel Integration: Outputs marks in a structured Excel sheet format.
* High Accuracy: Leverages CNN for precise recognition, even with diverse handwriting styles.
* Error Reduction: Minimizes manual entry errors and improves reliability.
* OBE Compatibility: Supports Outcome-Based Education systems for performance evaluation.

# Prerequisites
* Python 3.7 or higher
* Libraries: TensorFlow, OpenCV, Openpyxl, NumPy, Pandas
* Any IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, PyCharm)
  
# Installation
Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/hanishka1024/AI_MarksEntrySystem.git
